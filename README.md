Objective: To develop and transplant an artificial multi-tracheal syrinx (with 4 membranes per trachea) into any 2 familiar subjects to support multi-frequency vocalization. Teach them to hold a conversation with at least 5 different birds. Create finite automaton diagrams of RP (repertoire units), classify interpretations, and send the results to other animals for analysis
