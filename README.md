### Whatâ€™s up?

My name is Vasiliy.

Currently I'm doing a blockchain development with the Substrate framework.
I'm also interested in statically typed functional programming, compilers, type theory and formal verification. I like Haskell, PureScript, OCaml and Coq. Also I'm a big Nix and NixOS fan.
